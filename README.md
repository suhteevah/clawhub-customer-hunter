## Quick Start
```bash
cd proposal-generator
npm install
cp config/env.example .env   # Fill in your Gmail credentials
node scripts/send_email.js    # Test email sending
```

## Setup

### 1. Gmail App Password
You need a Gmail App Password (NOT your regular password) to send emails:
1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
3. Copy the 16-character password
4. Add it to your `.env` file

### 2. Environment Variables
```bash
GMAIL_USER=your.email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage with Claude Code

### Generate and send a proposal
```
claude "Generate a proposal for [Business Name] at [URL] and email it to [email]. This is a [cold/homie/inbound] outreach."
```

### Add a new prospect
```
claude "Add [Business Name] to the client database with email [email] and mark as [cold/homie/inbound]"
```

### Batch proposals
```
claude "Generate and send proposals for all prospects in clients.json that don't have proposals yet"
```

## Email Tones
- **cold** — Professional but direct, leads with findings, pitches services
- **homie** — Casual friend sharing useful info, no sales pitch
- **inbound** — Responding to their inquiry, validates their ask with research

## Dependencies
- `docx` — Word document generation
- `nodemailer` — Email sending via Gmail SMTP
- `dotenv` — Environment variable management
